## Contents :

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Data set : Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset csv file
- Readme file : Doc outlining projects
- Juptyer Notebook : Code for projects
- Expanded : New expanded dataset csv file
- PNG : Picture


## Jupyter Notebook:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Launch Jupyter Notebook by opening your terminal and navigating to the directory where you will save your notebook.
Type in jupyter notebook in the terminal and a browser window will open with the notebook interface. Go to the notebook required and click open. Cells can be a code cell or a markdown cell. To run a code cell click on save and then the run icon.



## Libraries Used :

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Pandas is an open source python package that is used for data anaylsis and machine learning
- Numpy is a Python programming language used for working with arrays
- Seaborn library uses Matplotlib to plot graphs and visuals random distribution
- Matplotlib library is used for creating static and interative visualisations
- Statistics provides functions for creating mathematical statistics of numeric data.
- sklearn library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.


## Project :

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project I will investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. This is a well-known dataset for evaluating machine-learned predictive models.  

This project will show the following:

- Review the data and give a background
- Literature review on the classifers
- Analysis of the data
- Use and train a set of classifers and present the results
- Compare with results from Literature Review
- Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended
